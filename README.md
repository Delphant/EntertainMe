## About
This project was created as our final project for the Sacred Heart University Jach Welsh Computer Science & Information Technology Graduate program. We had six weeks to design and analyze a project using an agile workflow, then another six weeks to implement our prototype.
EntertainMe! is a movie and TV show recommendation web application where users can rate and review media they have seen while getting new recommendations based on the items they view.

## Design Process
The design phase started our course CS620 Info Analysis and System Design. Our objective for this six-week course was to develop a capstone idea and design how the system would function. For our documentation, we simulated the cost analysis as if the project would go on to be a finished product. Our project development followed an agile workflow approach, which involved weekly meetings to present deliverables and decide on the next steps to be taken.
